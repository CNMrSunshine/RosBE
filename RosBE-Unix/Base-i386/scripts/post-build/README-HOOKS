Place here all the hooks that will be executed after the build ends.
You have to name it that way: ID-name.sh
Scripts with lower IDs will be executed first.
All the hook scripts will receive as arguments the build target.
The hooks will be executed even if the build failed. You have
no way to know the result of the build once the hook is called.
